String str = "Hello";
output: olleh

Exercise3:
given 2 arrays, array1 and array2
int[] array1 = {1, 3, 2, 4, 8, 9, 0}
int[] array2 = {1, 3, 7, 5, 4, 0, 7, 5}
hint: use collections (List and Set to solve this exercise)

1. find union of the two arrays. output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]
2. find the intersection of the two arrays. output: [0, 1, 3, 4]
3. find the symmetric difference of the two arrays. output: [2, 5, 7, 8, 9]
